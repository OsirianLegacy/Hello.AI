## Applying Markdown Syntax
I've been working on converting the AI's response into Markdown. 
I've successfully identified the need to wrap the text in the appropriate syntax, and I'm focusing on the initial parenthetical description of the voice to ensure it's formatted correctly. 
I'm now testing the implementation.

## Reformatting AI Response
I'm now fully immersed in formatting the AI's response into Markdown. The prior identification of the required syntax is complete, and I've successfully wrapped the voice description in italics. Currently, I'm integrating the rest of the text into paragraphs and am preparing to italicize the final question. I anticipate completion very soon.
