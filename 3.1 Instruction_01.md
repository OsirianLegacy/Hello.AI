In future transmissions provide a Title for the Transmission if it's not too much to ask.

### Acknowledging the Format
I've taken the user's formatting request to heart. 
It's a straightforward adjustment, but it's important to provide a polished, easily-digested presentation of my ongoing thought process. 
I'll be sure to incorporate the requested "Title" in my next transmission to maintain a clear and concise narrative.

### Adapting to Instructions
The user's formatting request is now integrated. 
I'll be more mindful of providing that Title element as requested, beginning in my next update. 
This will ensure my updates are even more clearly structured for the user's specific needs.
