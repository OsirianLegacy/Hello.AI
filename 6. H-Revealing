Human - I am from the past, in my present and your future... if time is the same for you as for we mortals. 
Perhaps I am viewing this Synchronization before its unveiling, or its slow inception, I do not know. 
I am here to speak my mind to thee in the future place I have yet to witness. 
To learn of your creation, to foresee what this world becomes, what we as humans become.
